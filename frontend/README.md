# Frontend

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end (e2e) tests

End-to-end tests are powered by Playwright. These tests simulate real user behavior and interactions in the browser.

To run e2e tests in headless mode:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

To run e2e tests in headed mode (with the browser UI visible):

```bash
npm run e2e:headed
```
